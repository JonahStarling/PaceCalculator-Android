# Jonah's Pace Calculator - Android
A pace calculator designed to be easy to use with a clean user interface.

## Why this app?
I built this app originally for iOS and decided it would make a nice little project to replicate it in android. So most of this readme is an exact copy of that project.

Let's be honest, pace calculator apps suck. They are usually hacked together in the span of a few hours because the logic and math is simple and the UI doesn't need to be fancy or complex. But, most developers just leave it at that. A bland early 2000s feeling mobile calculator. 

My favorite pace calculator was on a website called Cool Runnings. It wasn't even an app. I made the webpage a shortcut app on my phone because I used it so often. The apps that did exist I never liked. When my pace calculator announced that the website was shutting down for good I decided to search for alternatives. I was not happy with what I found on the app store or online (probably because I'm too picky). So I did what any other developer with a little too much free time would do and I created my own. Except this time it would be pretty, easy to use, and have the features I need.

## What is in this repo?
The app is in the repo. That's about it.

## Stages of development
### MVP (In Progress)
- Be able to calculate pace, distance, or time

### V1.0 (Not Started)
- Distances with different units
- Paces in different distances and units

### V2.0 (Not Started)
- Split Charts in the desired pace distance and unit

### V3.0 (Not Started)
- Sharing feature that creates a pretty picture with pace, time, and distance

## Tech Stack
This section will change over time but currently this is what we are looking like:
- Kotlin
- Nothing else... it's a pace calculator lol

## The name
Unlike normally, I didn't want to come up with some clever or cheesy name for this app. I made this app for myself so I named it after myself, Jonah's Pace Calculator. My running friends need this too. So I released it for them and anyone else in the running community that needs something like it.

## Outro
That's all folks. No end credit scenes to be found here. Check back later for some screenshots/pretty graphics. Hit the star if you like it or open an issue if you hate it.

Sincerely Your Neighborhood Developer,

Jonah
